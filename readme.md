# graphql-react-course

Youtube course from The Net Ninja channel

The main goal of this repository is to learn graphql api basics and implement that with react front-end to be used in later projects.
Found this course to be simple EXTREMELLY helpful.
Thanks The Net Ninja to provide that.

This project was bootstrapped with [Create React App](https://github.com/facebook/create-react-app).
